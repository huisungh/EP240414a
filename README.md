# EP240414a
This repository contains the EP data and optical data of EP240414a in the paper entitled A fast X-ray transient from a weak relativistic jet associated with a type Ic-BL supernova.

WXT.zip contains the WXT light curve in T100 (WXT_lc_T100, in Figure 2) and the spectral data T90 (WXT_spec_T90, in Extended Data Figure 1) of EP240414a.
For data in both files, they are
